Personalized AI: Creating an AI that mimics a teacher's thought process and responds to user questions, generating real-time content.

Interactive Labels: Adding labels that appear when users interact with specific parts of the 3D model, providing names and descriptions.

Content Creation by Users: Allowing content creators to use a user-friendly interface for drag-and-drop model creation without needing extensive technical skills.

Recording User Interactions: Tracking user behavior to better understand their interests and provide tailored responses from the AI.

Mixing 2D and 3D Content: Combining 2D elements (like formulas) with 3D models for a more comprehensive understanding of subjects.
